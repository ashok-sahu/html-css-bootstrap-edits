  <p>Have you tried to run a marathon with no practice?
  
  I hope not. You might pull a muscle.
  
  You need to start small in order to achieve something big like that.
  
  When it comes to learning English, what if I told you that you can understand big ideas with just a little bit of text?
  
  You do not need to wait several years to deal with complex concepts.
  
  Just because you are learning a language does not mean you need to limit your thinking.
  
  Stories are all about going beyond reality. It is no wonder that they let you understand big concepts with only a little bit of reading practice.
  
  But this works better when you’re reading better stories.
  
  I am talking about award-winning short stories, told using language easily understood by beginners. These will not only improve your English reading comprehension but also open your mind to different worlds.</p>
